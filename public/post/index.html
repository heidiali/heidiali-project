<p>Hei ja tervetuloa! Hello and welcome! My name is Heidi, I&rsquo;m living in greater Helsinki area, quite close to the city. I&rsquo;m one of the people who wandered to FiTech course selection and decided to roll for some coding fun in the evenings. Or more like DevOps fun. During my time off I also enjoy heading outdoors, a selection of sports activities and naturally chilling. What do I do for a living then? I&rsquo;m junior coder, learning more and doing some web development, mostly. My interests are broad and I still aim to learn various sofwares and systems in IT industry. Basically, at the moment I feel I&rsquo;m mostly constantly continuously learning about new tools and working methods.</p>

      Learning DevOps Here are some thoughts on the topic of learning on the course CS-EJ4104. The were many topics that were mentioned, and I will only mention a few. Also some of my own thoughts on things that I found tricky or easy.
 This was a good introduction to DevOps in my mind. The videos were very to the point, and I feel that they gave a good overview of CAMS and continuous improvement and the ways to achieve it.
