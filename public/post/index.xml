      <description>Learning DevOps Here are some thoughts on the topic of learning on the course CS-EJ4104. The were many topics that were mentioned, and I will only mention a few. Also some of my own thoughts on things that I found tricky or easy.
 This was a good introduction to DevOps in my mind. The videos were very to the point, and I feel that they gave a good overview of CAMS and continuous improvement and the ways to achieve it.</description>
