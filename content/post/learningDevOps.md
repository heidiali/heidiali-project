# Learning DevOps
Here are some thoughts on the topic of learning on the course CS-EJ4104. The were many topics that were mentioned, and I will only mention a few. Also some of my own thoughts on things that I found tricky or easy. 
* This was a good introduction to DevOps in my mind. The videos were very to the point, and I feel that they gave a good overview of CAMS and continuous improvement and the ways to achieve it. The stages and goals of each part of DevOps were clearly explained as were some tools that relate to the doing. It was also good to clear the difference between terms continuous delivery and continuous deployment, which were previously a bit mixed for me. 
* The cource had two quizzes. They were quite nice to complete with the help of the material, but indeed some options took a bit of browsing and checking notes. 
* I was more familiar with Git and Github, but it never hurts to recap. However Github Actions and CI in github were completely new to me and it was nice to get to experience this. 
* Creation of the web pages was done with Hugo framework, and this framework was something completely new to me. I had not used it before, so it took a moment to browse through guides. I found teh getting-started-guide to be very easy and nice though. 
* With GitHub, there were some new things for me, enabling GitHub Pages and using GitHub Actions by creating and adding a YAML workflow definition file to deploy the static project web page. As often is the case, the trickiest part is bringing it all together and working nicely. And in this case that would be getting the project to automatically deploy after any updates in main branch. But in the end it all worked out.
